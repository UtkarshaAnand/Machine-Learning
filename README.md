Predicting Interview Appearance
This Machine Learning Project is on predicting interview appearance.
The model is to be used by a recruiting agency that acts as a bridge between a recruiting company and candidates.
The recruiting agency gets payed by the companies for sending the required number of candidates for the interview to the companies.
This model predicts whether a candidate appears for the interview or not.
We have a dataset of 1233 records and 22 features excluding the outcome.
'Observed Attendance' is the name of the column that comprise of the outcome.
The IPython Notebook shows all the models tested and the model finally selected.
